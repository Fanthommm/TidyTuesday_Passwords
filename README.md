# TidyTuesday_Passwords
Data Analysis project based on Tidy Tuesday's 2020 dataset "Passwords"

# Introduction
The database contains a single table containing 500 individuals and 9 variables. The variables are as follows: rank (the ranking order of usage), password (the password), category (password category based on their theme), value (the time required for online cracking), time_unit (the time unit of the previous column), offline_crack_sec (the time in seconds for offline cracking), rank_alt (another popularity ranking), strength (the strength of a password obtained based on its membership in specified classes in the documentation), and finally font_size. Considering these elements, the purpose of our project could be to understand and explain the various mechanisms influencing password strength and the time required for cracking it. We can also examine the impact of password categories in our analysis.
